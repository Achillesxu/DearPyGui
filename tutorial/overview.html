            This tutorial is intended to demonstrate how to use some features of Dear PyGui ("DPG").
            It is also recommended to refer to the <a href="../api_docs.html">API Reference</a> for the information on a command specifics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dear PyGui consists of a viewport, windows, and widgets. The viewport is the main window of your program and is created
            by calling the function <i>start_dearpygui</i>
            <br><br>
            In the next example please look at the about window and verify that you have the latest Dear PyGUI package installed.
            <br><br>
            Here is an example of the viewport and a window showing documentation using the built-in documentation function:
        </p>
        <pre><code data-language="python">from dearpygui.core import *
from dearpygui.simple import *

set_main_window_size(800, 800)
show_about()
show_documentation()

# when running this code please look at the about window and it will report which version of Dear PyGUI is running
start_dearpygui()</code> </pre>
        <p>
            DPG is currently made up of two modules <i>dearpygui.core</i> and <i>dearpygui.simple</i>.
            <br><br>
            <i>dearpygui.core</i> contains the core functionality of Dear PyGui. Everything else is built on top of core.
            <br><br>
            <i>dearpygui.simple</i> contains simple wrappers and other utilities created from <i>core</i> to provide a more pleasant interface to DPG. As your code
            complexity grows its recommended to start using the <i>simple</i> module when applicable.
            <br><br>
            Throughout the tutorial we will use the recommended procedures for accomplishing various tasks. This will include a mix of <i>core</i> and <i>simple</i>
            functions.
            <br><br>
            It is also worth mentioning that we will be using <i>from module import *</i> which is against best practices however will be less distracting while learning DPG.
